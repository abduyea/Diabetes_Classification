Diabetes Classification Experiment
                   1. Introduction
`	The project aimed to classify diabetes based on health features, using multiple machine learning models. The dataset includes attributes like glucose, blood pressure, and BMI, with the goal of predicting whether a patient has diabetes (binary classification). The task involved preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.
                    2. Data Preprocessing
 2.1 Dataset Overview

 The dataset for this project, diabetes.csv, consisted of health-related features of patients, including:
Glucose: Blood glucose level.
BloodPressure: Blood pressure levels.
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Outcome: Target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

      2.2 Missing Value Treatment

Certain features (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI) contained zero values, which were considered biologically implausible for these health-related measurements. These zero values were treated as missing (NaN) and subsequently imputed using the median of each respective column. This approach ensured that valuable information was retained during preprocessing.

        2.3 Feature Scaling

Feature scaling was performed using StandardScaler, which standardized the numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is particularly important for distance-based models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), ensuring that all features contribute equally during model training.
       2.4 Class Balancing

The dataset exhibited class imbalance, with a lower representation of diabetic patients (minority class). To address this, the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied to oversample the minority class. This ensured that the models were not biased toward predicting the majority class and improved overall model performance, particularly in identifying diabetic patients.

       3. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

3.1 PCA for Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the number of features to 5 principal components. This technique effectively summarized the underlying structure of the data while retaining a significant portion of its variance. This reduction aimed to improve model performance by focusing on the most informative dimensions and mitigating noise.

       3.2 Explained Variance

The explained variance ratio for each principal component was calculated, providing insight into the proportion of the original data's variance captured by the reduced dimensions. This step is essential for understanding the extent to which PCA preserved the important information from the original dataset.
            4. Model Training and Evaluation

4.1 Models Evaluated
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated for this task:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

          4.2 Model Evaluation

Each model was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation, calculating the F1-score to assess performance across multiple partitions of the training data. Following cross-validation, each model was trained on the entire training set and subsequently tested on the held-out test set. Performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrices were computed and analyzed.

          4.3 Results and Comparison

The models were compared based on their classification performance, utilizing:
Classification Report: Presenting precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy for each class.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the model's performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

          5. Results and Insights

5.1 Model Comparison

Logistic Regression and SVM generally outperformed the other models, achieving higher F1-scores. The application of SMOTE significantly improved the performance of the models, particularly in their ability to predict the minority class (diabetic patients).

         5.2 Insights from Visualizations

Class Distribution: Visualizing the class distribution before and after SMOTE highlighted the effectiveness of the class balancing technique.

PCA Histograms: The histograms of the principal components provided insights into the data distribution in the reduced feature space after dimensionality reduction.

Confusion Matrices: The confusion matrix heatmaps offered a clear visual representation of each model's performance, illustrating the patterns of correct and incorrect classifications.

          6. Conclusion
          
This experiment successfully classified diabetes using multiple machine learning models. Logistic Regression and SVM demonstrated the most robust performance, likely due to their capacity to model complex decision boundaries. The SMOTE technique proved critical in addressing class imbalance and improving the models' ability to accurately predict the minority class.
